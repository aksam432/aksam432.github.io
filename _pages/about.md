I am a computational material scientist with extensive experience  in materials modeling and scientific software development. My area of research focuses on the development and application of machine learning methods to accelerate materials discovery. I strive to work in a place where I could utilize my problem-solving, programming, and scientific knowledge to solve complex real-life challenges.
